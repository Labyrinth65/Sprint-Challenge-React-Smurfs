1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server side receives all of the elements(html css js) every time an action is completed by the user, and the page is refreshed, client side allows page to not have to be refreshed due to javascript already loaded on the page, and grabs only the part of the data that is needed to display changes when an action is completed by the user

Server side webpages are also optimized by search engine, while client side is less optimized
